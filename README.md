# WDI20-PROJECT1
Project1 for week ending week 2. 

# ***Space N Crater***. 

This was my first project at General Assembly.
The brief was to build a game .
I used Javascript and basic CSS to build Space N Crater.

My game involves Asteroids being catapulted towards Earth at different speeds with forcefield barriers being used to repel the asteroids to save Earth. 2 Players with 3 chances each and a scoreboard showing the winner. Each player has a chance to attack Earth with 3 different speeds, and also a chance to repel the asteroids.

Technologies used:
HTML
CSS
Javascript
jQuery
